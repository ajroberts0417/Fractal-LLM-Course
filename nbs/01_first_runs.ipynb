If we can be so bold: our Agent will be a Jarvis-lite, laser-focused on a narrow scope.

    "#### Silent Failures in AI Models\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs, and Machine Learning models more generally, often fail in different ways than other, standard software fails. For instance, some classic bugs in a regular piece of software include: type mismatches, syntax errors, compilation errors, etc. In other words these failures stem from a clearly *wrong* operation or step (aka a bug) that snuck into the code. We wanted the computer to do `X`, but we told it to do `Y` instead by accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, ML models often have \"silent\" failure modes. There is no syntax or compilation error - the program runs and completes fine. But, there is *something* still wrong in the code: adding where we should have subtracted, grabbing the wrong element from a list, or using the wrong mathematical function. There is no type checker or compiler that would or even could catch these errors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The fix for the silent failures above is clear: careful inspection of the code, monitoring and validation of the outputs, and clarity in both the algorithms and models we are using. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is another, unfortunate kind of silent failure: `version` mismatches. These failures are immune to our careful debugging eyes or logical checks. Version failures happen when we use a different version of a programming library than the version originally used by the model. As the software libraries we rely on are frequently updated, both subtle and major changes in their internals can affect the output of a model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These version failures are the main reason for being consistent and disciplined with our model's programming environment. We already have to stay vigilant for any logical silent failures. A good environment setup keeps us focused on the important conceptual part of our model instead of getting bogged down with tracking and matching software versions. \n",

    "There is a nice benefit to spending this much time and effort up front on our environment.  \n",

To weave in groundbreaking improvements as they are released. To work in the latest and greatest models. The LLM world is our oyster, and our environment skills the grain of sand soon made pearls. \n"
